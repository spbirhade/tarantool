<title>Dynamic data model</title>
<blockquote><para>
  This chapter describes how Tarantool stores 
  values and what operations with data it supports.
</para></blockquote>

<para>
  Tarantool data is organized in <emphasis>tuples</emphasis>. Tuple
  cardinality is varying: a tuple can contain any number
  of fields. A field can be either numeric &mdash;
  32- or 64- bit unsigned integer, or binary
  string &mdash; a sequence of 8-bit octets.  The first field of a
  tuple is always assumed to be
  the identifying (unique) key. The remaining fields make up a 
  value, associated with the key.
  Tuple sets are called <emphasis>namespaces<alt>perhaps, not the best name</alt></emphasis>, and there can be up to 255 namespaces defined per
  one Tarantool instance.

  Apart from the primary key, it is possible to define secondary
  <emphasis>indexes</emphasis> on other tuple fields. A secondary index does
  not have to be unique, and can cover several fields.
  If a namespace has a secondary index, tuple cardinality must be
  at least equal to the ordinal number of the field
  participating in the index.
</para>
<para>
  Currently, entire server <emphasis>schema</emphasis> must be
  specified in the configuration file. The schema contains all
  namespaces and indexes. A server started with a configuration
  file that doesn't match contents of its data directory will most
  likely crash, but may also behave in a non-defined way. 
  It is, however, possible to stop the server,
  add new namespaces to the schema or temporarily disable
  existing namespaces, and then restart the server.
</para>
<para>
  Schema objects, such as namespaces and indexes, are referred to
  by a numeric id. For example, to insert a tuple, is is necessary
  to provide id of the destination namespace; to select
  a tuple, one must provide the identifying key, namespace id and
  index id of the index used for lookup.
</para>

<para>
  The configuration file shipped with the binary package defines
  only one namespace with id <literal>0</literal>. It has no keys
  other than the primary. The primary key numeric id is also 
  <literal>0</literal>. Tarantool command line client
  supports a small subset of SQL, and we'll use it to demonstrate
  supported data manipulation commands:
  <programlisting>
  tarantool> insert into t0 values (1)
  Insert OK, 1 row affected
  tarantool> select * from t0 where k0=1
  Found 1 tuple:
  [1]
  tarantool> insert into t0 values ('hello')
  An error occurred: ERR_CODE_ILLEGAL_PARAMS, 'Illegal parameters'
  tarantool> insert into t0 values (1, 'hello')
  Insert OK, 1 row affected
  tarantool> select * from t0 where k0=1 
  Found 1 tuple:
  [1, 'hello']
  tarantool> update t0 set k1='world' where k0=1
  Update OK, 1 row affected
  tarantool> select * from t0 where k0=1
  Found 1 tuple:
  [1, 'world']
  tarantool> delete from t0 where k0=1
  Delete OK, 1 row affected
  tarantool> select * from t0 where k0=1
  No match</programlisting>

  <itemizedlist>
    <title>Please observe:</title>
    <listitem><para>
      Since all object identifiers are numeric, Tarantool SQL subset
      expects identifiers that end with a number (<literal>t0</literal>,
      <literal>k0</literal>, <literal>k1</literal>, and so on):
      this number is used to refer to the actual namespace or
      index.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
       All commands actually tell the server which key/value pair
       to change. In SQL terms, that means that all DML statements
       must be qualified with the primary key. WHERE clause
       is, therefore, mandatory.
    </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>
       INSERT turns into REPLACE when a tuple with given
       primary key already exists. Such replace can insert
       a tuple of different cardinality.
    </para></listitem>

<para>
  Since not all NoSQL operations can be expressed in SQL, to gain
  complete access to data manipulation functionality one must use
  a Perl, Python, Ruby or C connector. The client/server protocol
  is open and documented: an annotated BNF can be found in the
  source tree, file <filename
  xlink:href="https://github.com/mailru/tarantool/blob/master/doc/box-protocol.txt" xlink:title="A complete BNF of Tarantool client/server protocol">doc/protocol.txt</filename>.
